## Active Context

### Current Focus
- Establish overall plan for building the habit tracker (feature breakdown, architecture, roadmap).
- Capture requirements in memory bank and align on tech stack.

### Recent Activity
- Initialized documentation (project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context).
- Clarified key modules: calendar heatmap + to-do synergy.

### Next Steps
1. Produce implementation plan/roadmap for MVP.
2. Scaffold Vite + React + Tailwind project.
3. Design data schema + decide backend integration approach.

### Considerations
- Need decision on state management and data fetching library.
- Determine how SQLite interacts with frontend (server API vs direct).
- UX for toggling progress from both views must stay in sync.
