## Product Context

### Problem
Existing habit trackers often separate calendar visualization and task management; switching between tools breaks momentum and lowers completion rates. We want a single interface that keeps motivation high by showing visual progress while enabling actionable daily checklists.

### Target Users
- Individuals building routines (fitness, study, wellness).
- Makers wanting GitHub-like visual streak representations.
- Users who appreciate minimal UI but need data persistence across devices.

### Experience Goals
- Quick onboarding: default habits or templates optional, but adding habit should be frictionless.
- Visual reinforcement: contributions-like grid with color intensity to show streak quality.
- Dual entry points: mark a habit done either from the daily list or from the calendar cells.
- Simple insights: show current streak, completion rate, maybe weekly summary.

### Key Scenarios
1. User creates a new habit, sets frequency (daily baseline).
2. User checks daily list, marks a habit as done; heatmap updates.
3. User sees missed days in calendar and clicks to retroactively log completion.
4. User reviews metrics/stats to stay motivated.
