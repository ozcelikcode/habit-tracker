# Product Context

- Problem: People lose momentum on habits when feedback loops are weak; GitHub-style streak visuals can reinforce consistency.
- Users: Individuals (personal use), English-only experience for now.
- Experience goals: frictionless logging, visually rewarding streaks, clear 3-day grace handling, and site-internal push notifications. Offline use allowed after initial load (assets/design served online) with cached assets/API.
- Differentiators: contribution-graph-like views per habit, per-day task details on click, tooltips with completion counts, and strict no-backdating for honest tracking.
- Confirmed boundaries: no social features, no gamification, no other integrations, Istanbul timezone and TR date formats, SQLite storage, daily backups, JSON export/import, Prisma ORM, E2E encryption expected.
- Design direction: sharp, modern, minimal/professional UI with a high-quality serif font (not Times New Roman), using Tamagui for styling.
- Open details: exact E2E scope/keys handling.
