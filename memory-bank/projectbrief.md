## Habit Tracker Project Brief

### Vision
Build a modern habit tracking web application where users can log daily progress either through a calendar heatmap (GitHub contribution style) or via a to-do style checklist. The experience should feel fast, lightweight, and visually motivating.

### Core Requirements
- Stack: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS on the frontend, SQLite for persistence (likely via lightweight backend API or local persistence layer).
- Features: calendar heatmap showing habit completion, daily to-do list for habits, ability to mark progress from either UI, light/dark friendly theme.
- Non-functional: responsive design, data stored reliably, supportive UX for streak tracking.

### Success Metrics
- Users can add/edit/delete habits.
- Users can mark completion from calendar or to-do list.
- Calendar heatmap updates immediately when tasks are completed.
- Persistence across sessions using SQLite data store.
